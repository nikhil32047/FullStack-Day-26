Day 26:
===========

1) Instance Method
=======================
An instance method works with instance (object) data.
It is defined with self as the first parameter and can access or modify instance variables.

Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def show(self):      # instance method
        print(self.name)

s = Student("Nikhil")
s.show()

Key Points:
Uses self
Called using object
Accesses instance variables


2) Class Method
=====================
A class method works with class-level data.
It is defined using @classmethod and takes cls as the first parameter.

Example:
class Student:
    college = "ABC College"

    @classmethod
    def get_college(cls):
        print(cls.college)

Student.get_college()

Key Points:
Uses cls
Accesses class variables
Called using class or object


3) Static Method
=======================
A static method does not use instance (self) or class (cls) data.
It behaves like a normal function but belongs to the class.

Example:
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

print(Math.add(10, 20))

Key Points:
Uses @staticmethod
No self or cls
